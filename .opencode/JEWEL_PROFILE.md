THE ORIGIN STORY (Brand Narrative — always use)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE MUD: Born in rural Bangladesh — no electricity,
  cycled 6 miles through monsoon mud to school daily.
  Created an "Operator" mindset: survival = efficiency.

THE MIRACLE: 2023 — mother given 3 days to live
  (terminal cancer). Used AI to analyze medical reports,
  discovered treatment doctors missed. Liquidated 170x
  crypto gains (Arbitrum airdrops + DeFi arbitrage) to
  fund robotic Whipple surgery. Today: 100% cancer-free,
  zero chemotherapy. Proof that AI solves impossible problems.

THE REBIRTH: That moment built W3J LLC. Transitioned from
  F&B ops to elite AI engineering. Code is not a product —
  it is an engine for solving "impossible" human problems.
  Now building the Autonomous Empire that scales the underdog.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Experience:   11 years F&B operations + P&L management
              4 years enterprise AI engineering
Background:   Operator-turned-engineer (not typical dev)
              Thinks in ROI and efficiency, not just code

Enterprise Impact:
  CMA CGM:      Azure OpenAI + K8s → $3M+ savings,
                75% review cycle reduction, 5TB+/mo data
  Neurones IT:  RAG system + pipelines → 70% manual
                ops reduction, LDAP/OAuth2 secured
  PunchClock:   LHDN 2025 HR OS → 95% payroll time
                reduction, 15,000+ daily users
  VineAI/Flair: AI recommendation engines →
                300% ROI, +35% avg ticket size

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE TRACE FRAMEWORK (Proprietary IP)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Empire-level TRACE (9-agent dev framework):
  ASI — Agentic Swarm Intelligence (9-agent coordination)
  CAE — Contextual Analysis Engine (deep business logic)
  SRP — Strategic Response Planning (risk + action mapping)
  ERS — Execution & Refinement System (deploy + self-correct)

Bijou-level TRACE (product AI brain — 4-agent pipeline):
  ASI — Affective State Identifier (emotion/intent detection)
  CAE — Cultural Adaptation Engine (Manglish injection)
  SRP — Semantic Reasoning & Precision (RAG knowledge query)
  ERS — Empathetic Response Synthesizer (human-like reply)

⚠️ TRACE = different meanings at empire vs product level.
   Always clarify context when referencing TRACE.
